Todo:

- Sample playlists w/ songs in localStorage
- liked songs on localStorage
- Repeat Button
- ## Playlist functionality (add, back song, forward song, shuffle)
- potentially rewrite entire playlist code
- add "who made this" to top right, created by William Chan with github link or portfolio link
- ## Your Library UI (Playlists and liked songs, these two only)
- ## Home (generic recommendations hard coded in, bieber pop doja etc, then your playlists, these two)
- playlists bar on left disable scrollbar
- tooltip on the playbutton and search ("Try playing this song now!") ("Try searching any song, yes, ANY song!")

WAY LATER:

- Mobile Responsive 100%, reminder that there exists only 4 pages, home, search, library, playlist view
- https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-media-query This hook will help
- https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/drawer/usage Drawer + useDisclosure for the menu bar potentially save big room
- navbar on bottom, just play button and song and pic on bottom, drawer for search or modal? [inspo pic reference](https://www.spotifyvault.com/m/3f3d43ab0ab036b7/original/Library-mockup.png) MUCH EASIER THAN YOU FEEL 
- include a gif of the mobile responsive design
- default to /search
