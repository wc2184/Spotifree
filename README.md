Todo:

- Sample playlists w/ songs in localStorage
- liked songs on localStorage
- Repeat Button
- ## Playlist functionality (add, back song, forward song, shuffle)
- potentially rewrite entire playlist code
- add "who made this" to top right, created by William Chan with github link or portfolio link
- ## Your Library UI (Playlists and liked songs, these two only)
- ## Home (generic recommendations hard coded in, bieber pop doja etc, then your playlists, these two)
- playlists bar on left disable scrollbar
- tooltip on the playbutton and search ("Try playing this song now!") ("Try searching any song, yes, ANY song!")

WAY LATER:

- Mobile Responsive 100%, reminder that there exists only 4 pages, home, search, library, playlist view
- https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-media-query This hook will help
- https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/drawer/usage Drawer + useDisclosure for the menu bar potentially save big room
- navbar on bottom, just play button and song and pic on bottom, drawer for search or modal? [inspo pic reference](https://www.spotifyvault.com/m/3f3d43ab0ab036b7/original/Library-mockup.png) MUCH EASIER THAN YOU FEEL 
- include a gif of the mobile responsive design
- default to /search 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
